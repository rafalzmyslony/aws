Some skills
Here are my various scripts - Terraform, Minikube, aws, python, Dockerfile

Currently there are two projects:
- Ansible awx in minikube cluster which is hosted on ec2 instance
(It creates one EC2 instance in AWS. Then install Python, Minikuke, creates kustomization file for Ansible AWX. Then Ansible AWX works in pods in Minikube cluster.)
- project1_flask_todo
this is simply todo app written in flask, which can be hosted on container or ec2 instances. This app uses postgresql database.
